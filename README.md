# hello-world
Just another repository.
I'm retired from the real world and wanted to get into some kind of coding. I've done some web design but it's been almost 20 years ago. I loved building stuff from Homesite, a HTML editor and then seeing the results on the www. 

Not sure I want to get back into web design, but would like to get into some kind of coding. Maybe making some money to help supplement income.
